Exploration 1 - Day 2 (files)
------------------------------
The current directory has a file "marks.txt" each
line of which contains the name of a student as well
as his mark.

Write a small python script which will print the sum of
marks of all the students.

Do it in two ways:

a) Read each line (using a for loop), split it into two parts,
convert the second part to int and add it to a cumulative sum.

b) Use a for comprehension to generate a list of marks, call the
sum function to sum it.


Which is more elegant?

c) Can you mention one disadvantage of using the for-comprehension?
