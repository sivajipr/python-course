Exploration 1 (Day 1) (list/tuple)
------------------------------------

a) Can you find out the approximate amount of memory consumed
by a Python list of integers of length 10000000?

b) Demonstrate the working of the "extend" method on lists

c) Demonstrate the working of the "index" method on lists

d) Demonstrate the working of the following list methods: count, reverse, pop

e) Lists have a "sort" method on them; there is also a function called "sorted".
   Find out in what way these are different


f) If you do b = a[::], it creates a "shallow copy" of 'a'. Your job is to find
out what is meant by this.

First, try out:

a = [1,2,[3,4]]

b = a[:]

b.append(10)

print b
print a

---
Then, try out:

b[2].append(5)
print b
print a

---

What do you find?
