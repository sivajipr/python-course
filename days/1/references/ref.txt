Here are some references which you can use to learn more:


a) The Python Practice book: http://anandology.com/python-practice-book/

b) The Official Python tutorial: http://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/

c) Google's Python class: https://developers.google.com/edu/python/ (a very quick
intro to some parts of Python)

d) http://swaroopch.com/notes/python/ (beginner-level book; based on Python3 - so
maybe a bit confusing as there are some differences between Python 2.x and Python 3.x)

e) http://www.diveintopython.net/toc/index.html (an intermediate-level book)

f) http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/html/index.html

The first two references may be best suited for our class.
