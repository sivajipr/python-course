Euler formula:

e**(i*theta) = cos(theta) + i*sin(theta)

substituting "pi" for theta:

e**(i*pi) = cos(pi) + i*sin(pi)

ie,

e**(i*pi) = -1 + i * 0
          = -1


Therefore:

e**(i*pi) + 1 = 0

This is the "euler identity".

Called by many as the "most beautiful theorem in mathematics"

It links together the five most important mathematical constants in 
a single equation: 0, 1, i, pi, e
