We see that (10**s - 1) / s seems to be converging to 
2.302.

Let's write, for small values of s:

(10**s - 1) / s = 2.3026

It follows that:

10**s - 1 = 2.3026*s

10**s = 1 + 2.3026*s

Let's now replace `s' by the value s/2.3026. We get:

10**(s/2.3026) = 1 + 2.3026*(s/2.3026) = 1 + s

that is:

10**(1/2.3026) = 2.7182

What is 2.7182? It is our "e"!!

So:

e**s = 1 + s

for small values of s.
